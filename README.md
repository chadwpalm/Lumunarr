#Lumunarr

Lumunarr is a connector application for controlling Philips Hue lighting using Plex webhooks. Actions like play, pause, stop, & resume will trigger lighting scenes through a Hue bridge. Lumunarr uses a graphical web interface for setting up multiple Plex client profiles which can be fine-tuned down to individual Plex users and media types.
